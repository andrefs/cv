\opening{Dear Sirs:} 
 
\noindent I am applying for the Summer School CDDIP 2011. I have 
been told about this school by my teacher Prof. João Miguel
Fernandes, Universidade of Minho, and by colleagues of mine 
who have attended previous editions.
%PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
%learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
 
\noindent I am very interested in the opportunity presented by 
this school, as I consider entrepreneurship and innovation as key 
aspects to a successful career. My degree in Software Engineering
has granted me the technical skills to develop software products
according to the best practices and standards, and also the needed
soft skills which make me a valuable asset on a team.
%PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain

%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
 
\noindent I am now on the last year of my MSc on Software 
Engineering, and I am currently writing my master thesis on the
field of natural language processing, entitled ``Building a 
Corpora-Flow System''. Additionally, I am attending classes from
the Bioinformatics MSc, motivated by the possibilities and 
challenges that such a new area presents. You can find more
detailed information on my academic background on my enclosed CV.

\noindent Thank you for your time and consideration. I look 
forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
%located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
%Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
%interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
%time to consider your credentials.
